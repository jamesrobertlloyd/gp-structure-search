%\begin{itemize}
%  \item Traditionally, a researcher / scientist / statistician would select an appropriate model for the type of structures present
%  \item Automatic model selection techniques already exist, typically choosing between a finite or restricted set of models
%  \item Instead, we automate statistical model \emph{construction}%, which allows for a very large set of models to be considered

\begin{itemize}
  \item Traditionally, a statistician proposes an appropriate model for the type of structures present
  \item Existing automatic model selection methods typically choose from a restricted set of models
  \item We define an open-ended grammar over models, and search it automatically.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.5\baselineskip}

\mysection{Gaussian processes model structure through kernels}

\vspace{0.5\baselineskip}

\begin{itemize}
  \item The kernel determines which structures are likely under the \gp{} prior  
  \item This prior determines the generalization properties of the model.
  \item Typically, one of the following standard \gp{} priors are used:

\mysection{\ldots defining a rich, open-ended set of models\ldots}

\vspace{0.25\baselineskip}

\begin{itemize}
  \item We search over all algebraic expressions combining
      \begin{itemize}
          \item a set of base kernels \{ \kSE, \kPer, \kLin, \kRQ \}
          \item the operators $+$ and $\times$
      \end{itemize}
  %\item These operations are interpretable\ldots
  %\begin{itemize}
  %  \item Addition of kernels corresponds to the addition of independent functions
  %  \item Multiplication of kernels behaves like an `AND' operation, combining properties of the base kernels
  %\end{itemize}
  %\item \ldots and produce a rich space including many standard statistical models

\begin{itemize}
  \item We try all base kernels, selecting the one with the highest (approximate) marginal likelihood which balances data fit and model complexity
  \item The search continues by adding an extra term to the current best kernel, stopping when marginal likelihood no longer improves
